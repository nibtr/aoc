The repo contains solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
problems, written in Go so I can learn more about the language. Currently
there's only year 2023, but I'm looking forward to adding more (if I'm 
not lazy).

>[!NOTE]
>Still ongoing

## Quick start

To run a day's solution:

```bash
go run ./2023/<dayxx>/main.go --part <1 or 2>
```

or you can run tests of a specific day, this will take input from the
website:

```bash
go test ./2023/<dayxx>
```
